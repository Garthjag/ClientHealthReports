# ClientHealthReports
These reports work in conjunction with ConfigMgr Client Health Script. They assume that ConfigMgr Health database is collocated with ConfigMgr Database. 

You will need to manually upload both the Power BI Report Server (PBRS) and the SQL Server Report Services (SSRS) reports to your reporting point.

RDLs can be uploaded to SSRS and PBRS.
PBIX can only be update to PBRS.

PBIX files can also be used with Power BI desktop.
